abstract={The development of targeted anti-cancer therapies through the study of cancer genomes is intended to increase survival rates and decrease treatment-related toxicity. We treated a transposon--driven, functional genomic mouse model of medulloblastoma with `humanized' in vivo therapy (microneurosurgical tumour resection followed by multi-fractionated, image-guided radiotherapy). Genetic events in recurrent murine medulloblastoma exhibit a very poor overlap with those in matched murine diagnostic samples (<5{\%}). Whole-genome sequencing of 33 pairs of human diagnostic and post-therapy medulloblastomas demonstrated substantial genetic divergence of the dominant clone after therapy (<12{\%} diagnostic events were retained at recurrence). In both mice and humans, the dominant clone at recurrence arose through clonal selection of a pre-existing minor clone present at diagnosis. Targeted therapy is unlikely to be effective in the absence of the target, therefore our results offer a simple, proximal, and remediable explanation for the failure of prior clinical trials of targeted therapy.},

	abstract = {Most of the evolutionary history reconstruction approaches are based on the infinite site assumption, which is underlying the Perfect Phylogeny model and whose main consequence is that acquired mutation can never lost. This results in the clonal model used to explain cancer evolution. Some recent results gives a strong evidence that recurrent and back mutations are present in the evolutionary history of tumors [5,21], thus showing that more general models then the Perfect Phylogeny are required. We propose a new approach that incorporates the possibility of losing a previously acquired mutation, extending the Persistent Phylogeny model [1].We exploit our model to provide an ILP formulation of the problem of reconstructing trees on mixed populations, where the input data consists of the fraction of cells in a set of samples that have a certain mutation. This is a fundamental problem in cancer genomics, where the goal is to study the evolutionary history of a tumor. An experimental analysis shows the usefulness of allowing mutation losses, by studying some real and simulated datasets where our ILP approach provides a better interpretation than the one obtained under perfect phylogeny assumption. Finally, we show how to incorporate multiple back mutations and recurrent mutations in our model.},

number={1},
pages={14944},
abstract={Several studies using genome-wide molecular techniques have reported various degrees of genetic heterogeneity between primary tumours and their distant metastases. However, it has been difficult to discern patterns of dissemination owing to the limited number of patients and available metastases. Here, we use phylogenetic techniques on data generated using whole-exome sequencing and copy number profiling of primary and multiple-matched metastatic tumours from ten autopsied patients to infer the evolutionary history of breast cancer progression. We observed two modes of disease progression. In some patients, all distant metastases cluster on a branch separate from their primary lesion. Clonal frequency analyses of somatic mutations show that the metastases have a monoclonal origin and descend from a common `metastatic precursor'. Alternatively, multiple metastatic lesions are seeded from different clones present within the primary tumour. We further show that a metastasis can be horizontally cross-seeded. These findings provide insights into breast cancer dissemination.},

The resulting intra-tumour heterogeneity plays an important role in cancer patient relapse and treatment failure, so that obtaining a clear understanding of each patient{\textquoteright}s tumour composition and evolutionary history is key for personalised therapies. Single-cell sequencing now provides the possibility to resolve tumour heterogeneity at the highest resolution of individual tumour cells, but brings with it challenges related to the particular noise profiles of the sequencing protocols as well as the uncertainty of the underlying evolutionary process. By modelling the noise processes and allowing mutations to be lost or to reoccur during tumour evolution, we present a method to jointly call mutations in each cell, reconstruct the phylogenetic relationship between cells, and determine the locations of mutational losses and recurrences. Our Bayesian approach allows us to accurately call mutations as well as to quantify our certainty in such predictions. We show the advantages of allowing mutational loss or recurrence with simulated data and present its application to tumour single-cell sequencing data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

However, recent studies leveraging single-cell sequencing (SCS) techniques have shown evidence of the widespread recurrence and, especially, loss of mutations in several tumor samples. While there exist established computational methods that infer phylogenies with mutation losses, there remain some advancements to be made.We present Simulated Annealing Single-Cell inference (SASC): a new and robust approach based on simulated annealing for the inference of cancer progression from SCS datasets. In particular, we introduce an extension of the model of evolution where mutations are only accumulated, by allowing also a limited amount of mutation loss in the evolutionary history of the tumor: the Dollo-k model. We demonstrate that SASC achieves high levels of accuracy when tested on both simulated and real datasets and in comparison with some other available methods.The SASC tool is open source and available at https://github.com/sciccolella/sasc.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

abstract = {Inferring phylogenetic trees is a fundamental problem in computational biology. We present a new objective criterion, the phylogenetic number, for evaluating evolutionary trees for species defined by biomolecular sequences or other qualitative characters. The phylogenetic number of a tree T is the maximum number of times that any given character state arises in T. By contrast, the classical parsimony criterion measures the total number of times that different character states arise in T. We consider the following related problems: finding the tree with minimum phylogenetic number, and computing the phylogenetic number of a given topology in which only the leaves are labeled by species. When the number of states is bounded (as is the case for biomolecular sequence characters), we can solve the second problem in polynomial time. Given the topology for an evolutionary tree, we can also compute a phylogeny with phylogenetic number 2 (when one exists) for an arbitrary number of states. This algorithm can be used to further distinguish trees that are equal under parsimony. We also consider a number of other related problems.}

abstract = {The binary perfect phylogeny model is too restrictive to model biological events such as back mutations. In this paper, we consider a natural generalization of the model that allows a special type of back mutation. We investigate the problem of reconstructing a near perfect phylogeny over a binary set of characters where characters are persistent: characters can be gained and lost at most once. Based on this notion, we define the problem of the Persistent Perfect Phylogeny (referred as P-PP). We restate the P-PP problem as a special case of the Incomplete Directed Perfect Phylogeny, called Incomplete Perfect Phylogeny with Persistent Completion, (refereed as IP-PP), where the instance is an incomplete binary matrix M having some missing entries, denoted by symbol ?, that must be determined (or completed) as 0 or 1 so that M admits a binary perfect phylogeny. We show that the IP-PP problem can be reduced to a problem over an edge colored graph since the completion of each column of the input matrix can be represented by a graph operation. Based on this graph formulation, we develop an exact algorithm for solving the P-PP problem that is exponential in the number of characters and polynomial in the number of species.}
